To work with Kubernetes, you use Kubernetes API objects to describe your cluster’s desired state: what applications
 or other workloads you want to run, what container images they use, the number of replicas, what network and disk
 resources you want to make available, and more. You set your desired state by creating objects using the Kubernetes
 API, typically via the command-line interface, kubectl. You can also use the Kubernetes API directly to interact
 with the cluster and set or modify your desired state.
Once you’ve set your desired state, the Kubernetes Control Plane works to make the cluster’s current state match
the desired state. To do so, Kubernetes performs a variety of tasks automatically–such as starting or restarting
containers, scaling the number of replicas of a given application, and more. The Kubernetes Control Plane consists
of a collection of processes running on your cluster
明月几时有，把酒问青天。不知天上宫阙，今夕是何年？我欲乘风归去，又恐琼楼玉宇，高处不胜寒。起舞弄清影，何似在人间！
转朱阁，低绮户，照无眠。不应有恨，何事长向别时圆？人有悲欢离合，月有阴晴圆缺，此事古难全。但愿人长久，千里共婵娟。
